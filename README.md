## The App

The original aim of the app was to gain more experience using react and apis by utilising the ClarifAI face recognition api.
I expanded upon this by using the celebrity face recognition model and add a Terminator theme to the app.  

The face recognition functionality remains however users uploading a piture of a Linda Hamilton (Sarah Connor) in the Terminator 1 & 2 films will cause the mission status to change. 

# Current state:

* The face recognition works correctly and draws a CSS-generated box around the face
* Uploading a picture of Linda Hamilton will cause the CSS-generated box to be displayed in red and the mission status to change

# Going forward:

* Draws boxes around all detected faces in the picture rather than just the first one (or Sarah Connor)
* Use the recognition probability percentage whilst rework the styling to make it more Terminator themed without it becoming too busy
* Sign in functionality
* Add a backend
